# Green Run

Description of your project goes here.

## Requirements
* nodejs (v14 or greater)

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```


```bash
npx husky install
```
> note:
Husky helps us save time and maintain quality by providing a tool that, through Git hooks, always runs commands like test execution and linting verification when creating a commit. If any of these steps fail, it prevents the commit from being created.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm run test
```
